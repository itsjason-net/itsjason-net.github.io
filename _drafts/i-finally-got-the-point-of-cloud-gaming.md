I'm not a big gamer, but every once in a while I decide to sit down and play something. Recently, my desire to play happened to coincide with me needing to be away from home, meaning I didn't have access to my Xbox. I also am deeply engrained in the Apple ecosystem, and the options for console-level gaming are very limited there. Combine those two scenarios, and I just figured I wouldn't be able to play. But then it dawned on me that this is exactly the scenario that cloud gaming will fix. 

> I know I'm late to the party on the topic of cloud gaming, but I still wanted to share my thoughts. Initially, the draw and the full use case didn't really sink in, and that's what this post is about. I'm still not quite sure how I missed it.

My first time launching Xbox cloud gaming was several months ago, and I launched it on my Xbox. The only reason I did was because I didn't have 150GB of available storage to install a game I wanted to try. It was a successful "experiment", and so in my mind I limited cloud gaming to answering that type of scenario, where disk usage was a problem, or perhaps you wanted to try out the game before deciding to devote the storage space to it. It never occurred to me until this week that there were other situations, like the one I was currently in, that cloud gaming could satisfy. Once I had this epiphany, I quickly confirmed that my Xbox controller can be [paired to my Macbook](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211232) via Bluetooth, and confirmed that Xbox Cloud gaming is [compatible with macOS](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/supported_browsers). With those two prerequisites out of the way, I logged into Xbox Cloud Gaming and gave it a whirl.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the concept of cloud gaming, it's quite the leap forward. Instead of using your native hardware to store the game and provide all the processing and graphics power to display the game, cloud gaming operates much more like a remote desktop session, where you're connecting to a remote "server". The remote system is doing all the heavy lifting of the graphics processing, and you're just sending the resulting images and the controller actions back and forth. This means that, assuming you have a decent internet connection, you can game from just about any device. And this is precicely the point I had overlooked previously.

You can look at the benefits of cloud gaming in a couple different lights. One, it makes higher tiers of gaming accessible to more people without having the sunk costs of high-end gaming consoles. Two, you become untethered from your home and a good TV and can participate in your favorite games from almost anywhere.

At the moment, cloud gaming is still fairly new, and so there are still certain limitations (and likely will be for a while). The most apparent restriction is the games that are available.
